# p-throttle

> Throttle promise-returning & async functions

It also works with normal functions.

It rate-limits function calls without discarding them, making it ideal for external API interactions where avoiding call loss is crucial.

## Install

```sh
npm install p-throttle
```

## Usage

Here, the throttled function is only called twice a second:

```js
import pThrottle from 'p-throttle';

const now = Date.now();

const throttle = pThrottle({
	limit: 2,
	interval: 1000
});

const throttled = throttle(async index => {
	const secDiff = ((Date.now() - now) / 1000).toFixed();
	return `${index}: ${secDiff}s`;
});

for (let index = 1; index <= 6; index++) {
	(async () => {
		console.log(await throttled(index));
	})();
}
//=> 1: 0s
//=> 2: 0s
//=> 3: 1s
//=> 4: 1s
//=> 5: 2s
//=> 6: 2s
```

## API

### pThrottle(options)

Returns a throttle function.

#### options

Type: `object`

Both the `limit` and `interval` options must be specified.

##### limit

Type: `number`

The maximum number of calls within an `interval`.

##### interval

Type: `number`

The timespan for `limit` in milliseconds.

##### strict

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `false`

Use a strict, more resource intensive, throttling algorithm. The default algorithm uses a windowed approach that will work correctly in most cases, limiting the total number of calls at the specified limit per interval window. The strict algorithm throttles each call individually, ensuring the limit is not exceeded for any interval.

#### signal

Type: [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal)

Abort pending executions. When aborted, all unresolved promises are rejected with `signal.reason`.

```js
import pThrottle from 'p-throttle';

const controller = new AbortController();

const throttle = pThrottle({
	limit: 2,
	interval: 1000,
	signal: controller.signal
});

const throttled = throttle(() => {
	console.log('Executing...');
});

await throttled();
await throttled();
controller.abort('aborted')
await throttled();
//=> Executing...
//=> Executing...
//=> Promise rejected with reason `aborted`
```

##### onDelay

Type: `Function`

Get notified when function calls are delayed due to exceeding the `limit` of allowed calls within the given `interval`. The delayed call arguments are passed to the `onDelay` callback.

Can be useful for monitoring the throttling efficiency.

In the following example, the third call gets delayed and triggers the `onDelay` callback:

```js
import pThrottle from 'p-throttle';

const throttle = pThrottle({
	limit: 2,
	interval: 1000,
	onDelay: (a, b) => {
		console.log(`Reached interval limit, call is delayed for ${a} ${b}`);
	},
});

const throttled = throttle((a, b) => {
	console.log(`Executing with ${a} ${b}...`);
});

await throttled(1, 2);
await throttled(3, 4);
await throttled(5, 6);
//=> Executing with 1 2...
//=> Executing with 3 4...
//=> Reached interval limit, call is delayed for 5 6
//=> Executing with 5 6...
```

### throttle(function_)

Returns a throttled version of `function_`.

#### function_

Type: `Function`

A promise-returning/async function or a normal function.

### throttledFn.isEnabled

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `true`

Whether future function calls should be throttled and count towards throttling thresholds.

### throttledFn.queueSize

Type: `number`

The number of queued items waiting to be executed.
